The following ABNF grammar defines the ZeroMQ Command & Control Protocol:

    ZCCP = greeting traffic
    
    greeting = C:hello S:ready
    traffic = subscribe / publish / request / reply

    ;         Client says hello to server and provides its identifier.
    hello           = signature %d1 identifier
    signature       = %xAA %xA10            ; two octets
    identifier      = string                ; Client identifier

    ;         Server accepts client
    ready           = signature %d2

    ;         Client subscribes to some set of events
    subscribe       = signature %d3 expression
    expression      = string                ; Regular expression

    ;         Client publishes an event, or server delivers to client
    publish         = signature %d4 header content
    header          = string                ; Header, for matching
    content         = chunk                 ; Event content

    ;         Request some action
    request         = signature %d5 method content
    method          = string                ; Requested method
    content         = chunk                 ; Event content

    ;         Reply to a command request
    reply           = signature %d6 status content
    status          = number-2              ; Success/failure status
    content         = chunk                 ; Event content

    ;         Client sent a message that was not valid at this time
    invalid         = signature %d7

    ; A chunk has 4-octet length + binary contents
    chunk           = number-4 *OCTET

    ; Strings are always length + text contents
    string          = number-1 *VCHAR

    ; Numbers are unsigned integers in network byte order
    number-1        = 1OCTET
    number-2        = 2OCTET
    number-4        = 4OCTET
